        "# Using Project Debater services for analyzing and finding insights in the survey data \n",
        "When you have a large collection of texts representing peopleâ€™s opinions (such as product reviews, survey answers or  social media), it is difficult to understand the key issues that come up in the data. Going over thousands of comments is prohibitively expensive.  Existing automated approaches are often limited to identifying recurring phrases or concepts and the overall sentiment toward them, but do not provide detailed or actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial you will gain hands-on experience in using Project Debater services for analyzing and deriving insights from open-ended answers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The data we will use is a community survey conducted in the city of Austin in the years 2016 and 2017 (https://data.world/cityofaustin/mf9f-kvkk). In this survey, the citizens of Austin where asked \"If there was ONE thing you could share with the Mayor regarding the City of Austin (any comment, suggestion, etc.), what would it be?\". \n",
        "\n",
        "We will analyze their open-ended answers in different ways by using four Debater services, the *Argument Quality* service, the *Key Point Analysis (KPA)* service, the *Term Wikifier* service and the *Term Relater* service, and we will see how they can be combined into a powerful text analysis tool."

For example, the sentence \"My car insurance went up 20% due to vehicle thefts and burglary\" mentions three Wikipedia concepts: The phrase \"car insurance\" is mapped to the concept *Vehicle insurance*; the phrase \"vehicle thefts\" is mapped to the concept *Motor vehicle theft* and the phrase \"burglary\" is mapped to the concept *Burglary*.\n",

We also demonstrated how key point analysis over unstructured text can be combined with available structured information, to provide new views over the data.   Finally, we showed how utilizing of additional Project Debater text analysis services such as *Argument Quality*, *Term Wikifier* , and *Term Relater* can further improve the quality of the results."
